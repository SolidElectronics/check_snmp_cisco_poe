# check_snmp_cisco_poe

This plugin for Nagios/Icinga/Op5 and other compatible systems checks the availability and power used by Power over Ethernet on a Cisco switch.
The plugin uses the [Power Ethernet MIB](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3621) to retrieve the data.
It works with SNMPv1, v2c and v3.

This plugin was created by Michiel Timmers. I have only added the performance data part to it.
